## üåç Overview

Our project introduces a **hybrid IoT-based architecture** designed to monitor, control, and balance transformer phases in real time ‚Äî ensuring **efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness** across both **urban and rural grids**.

This system integrates **smart hardware nodes**, **Raspberry Pi units**, and a **multi-layered data infrastructure** that communicates securely with a **central HQ server**.

> ‚ö° Built for scalability, designed for security, and optimized for real-time performance.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem Statement

Electric power grids today face severe **phase imbalance and load inefficiency** due to:
- Manual phase monitoring ‚öôÔ∏è  
- Overloaded transformers and frequent outages üî•  
- Lack of real-time visibility and data-driven decision-making üìä  
- High dependency on manual inspection and maintenance üë∑  

Such inefficiencies lead to **energy loss, equipment stress, and service instability**, especially in regions with **varying network conditions** (dense cities vs rural areas).

---

## üí° Core Objective

To design a **scalable, secure, and cost-effective hybrid IoT system** that:
- Automatically **detects and balances transformer loads** in real-time  
- Enables **reliable communication** from every node to the HQ server  
- Supports **urban, campus, and rural topologies** with adaptive connectivity  
- Aligns with **Smart India‚Äôs vision of sustainable energy management** ‚ö°

## üîÅ PI ‚Üí HQ Server Connectivity Plan

### üõ∞Ô∏è Cellular IoT Overview

- Cellular IoT (NB-IoT / LTE-M / 5G) is widely used in **smart meter grids** across India.
- Government bodies can **partner with telecom providers** for **IoT SIMs** with minimal monthly cost.
- Estimated cost: **‚Çπ20‚Äì‚Çπ50 per month per PI**, depending on data usage.

---

### üîπ **1Ô∏è‚É£ Cellular IoT (NB-IoT / LTE-M / 5G)** ‚Äì _High Connectivity Areas_

‚úÖ **Where:** Cities, towns, and regions with strong cellular tower coverage  
‚úÖ **How it works:**
- Direct communication from each **PI ‚Üí HQ Server**
- Real-time data transmission for instant monitoring and control
- Leverages **existing telecom infrastructure**, keeping costs low
- **Minimal latency**, enabling faster switching and alerts

---

### üîπ **2Ô∏è‚É£ LoRaWAN Mesh + Cellular IoT Gateway** ‚Äì _Low Connectivity Areas_

‚úÖ **Where:** Semi-urban or rural localities with weak or inconsistent cellular signals  
‚úÖ **How it works:**
- PIs with weak signals send their data through a **LoRaWAN mesh** to a nearby **gateway PI**
- The **gateway PI** aggregates and transmits the combined data to HQ using **Cellular IoT**
- Reduces total number of SIM cards required ‚Äî lowering overall operational costs  
- Ensures **reliable data reporting** even from remote clusters

üì° **Key Benefit:** ‚ÄúOne gateway, multiple PIs‚Äù ‚Äî scalable and cost-efficient.

---

### üîπ **3Ô∏è‚É£ Wired Connections** ‚Äì _Extremely Remote or No-Internet Areas_

‚úÖ **Where:** Very remote regions with **no cellular or internet coverage**  
‚úÖ **How it works:**
- Uses **wired RS-485 or Ethernet connections** between local PIs and HQ
- Deployed only in rare cases to ensure **full network coverage**
- Keeps infrastructure costs minimal by leveraging **existing power line routes**

---

> ‚öôÔ∏è **Hybrid Advantage:**  
> This three-tier architecture ensures **100% coverage** ‚Äî from dense cities to isolated villages ‚Äî while maintaining **low cost, high reliability, and full scalability**.

## üß± **Proposed Solution**

Our architecture is built in **modular layers**, ensuring **efficiency, scalability, and on-premise data control**.  
Each layer is optimized for a specific role in the data lifecycle ‚Äî from ingestion to visualization.

### üî∏ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Ingestion Layer

- **Protocol:** `MQTT over TLS` ‚Äî lightweight, encrypted, and secure communication between PIs and server.  
- **Broker:** `Apache Kafka` or `Redpanda` ‚Äî for high-throughput, low-latency message ingestion.  
  > Acts as a central **message queue**, ensuring reliability, buffering spikes, and preventing data loss.  
- **Edge Processing:**  
  - Each PI performs local preprocessing, aggregation, and buffering.  
  - Reduces network congestion and ensures graceful handling of outages.  

---

### üî∏ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Storage Layer

- **Time-Series Database:** `TimescaleDB` ‚Äî optimized for high-frequency sensor data, quick reads, and historical queries.  
- **Relational Database:** `PostgreSQL` ‚Äî manages configurations, user accounts, access roles, and metadata.
