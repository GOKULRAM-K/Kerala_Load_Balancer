## 🌍 Overview

Kerala’s energy infrastructure is evolving — and with it comes the challenge of ensuring **efficient, balanced, and intelligent power distribution** across every region.  
Our solution, the **Smart Phase Balancing and Hybrid IoT Power Distribution System**, redefines how transformers and homes communicate, coordinate, and optimize electricity delivery.

This project builds a **self-learning, hybrid IoT architecture** that connects every household node and transformer to a central intelligence layer — providing **real-time visibility**, **load balancing**, and **automated control** across both **urban and rural** grids.

It’s more than just monitoring — it’s about creating a power network that can *sense, decide, and act*.

---

> ⚡ **Built for Scalability. Designed for Security. Engineered for Real-Time Performance.**

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Kerala’s power grid spans a complex mix of **dense city networks, campuses, and rural terrains**.  
While urban regions are data-rich, rural and hilly areas still lack connectivity — resulting in **phase imbalance, transformer overloads, and manual dependency.**

Our system ensures that *no matter the terrain*, **every node, every transformer, and every watt of energy** is monitored, managed, and optimized.  
This architecture directly supports **KSEB’s vision for a Smart, Connected Kerala**, integrating renewable energy and improving grid resilience.

### 🚀 What Makes It Different

| Feature | Traditional Grid | Our Smart Grid |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Phase Monitoring | Manual, delayed | Real-time IoT sensing |
| Control | Manual switchovers | Automated balancing logic |
| Connectivity | Wired or single-channel | Hybrid (Cellular + LoRa + Wired) |
| Data Handling | Limited local logging | State-wide data ingestion & analytics |
| Scalability | Transformer-level | State-wide, modular, and scalable |
| Security | Minimal | TLS + AES + Role-Based Control |

> 🧠 *This isn’t just digitalization — it’s intelligence built into every transformer.*

## 💡 Core Objective

Our primary goal is to design a **modular, scalable, and cost-efficient hybrid IoT ecosystem** that enables smart, automated, and secure energy distribution.

### ✅ System Objectives

- Detect **phase imbalance and transformer overloads** automatically in real time.  
- Ensure **reliable communication** between every home node, transformer, and control center using hybrid connectivity.  
- Optimize **energy flow and distribution efficiency** with autonomous local decision-making at the edge.  
- Deliver **real-time dashboards and analytics** for monitoring, alerts, and performance insights.  
- Maintain **data security and compliance** through encryption, authentication, and audit tracking.  
- Support **urban, campus, and rural topologies** under one unified architecture.  
- Align with the **Smart India Mission** and **KSEB’s modernization roadmap** for sustainable grid transformation.

### 🧩 Design Essence

> **“Every transformer thinks. Every node communicates. Every decision optimizes the grid.”**

Our design philosophy is grounded in three pillars:

1. ⚙️ **Modularity** – Independent components (hardware, software, communication) that integrate seamlessly.  
2. 🧠 **Intelligence** – Edge analytics and centralized data insights for predictive and preventive action.  
3. 🔒 **Security & Reliability** – Multi-layer protection ensuring trusted and resilient energy communication.
